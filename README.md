# c-linkedlist
Playing with LinkedLists in C

## Overview
Recently playing with older C compilers, I wanted a LinkedList that offered some of the niceties of modern arrays found in more recent languages. I identified the most used key and value types I encounter in C which were a string (`char*`), a pointer (`void *`), an integer (`long`) and a decimal (`double`). I plan to add many more functions for handling things like searching, sorting and the like but this basis allows me to get started.
